# 🚀 My Embedded Linux & FPGA Career Journal

Welcome to my personal roadmap. This is where I document my learning, mini-projects, and progress as I build deep skills in **Embedded Linux** and **FPGA design**.

---

## 🎯 Career Goal

**Short Term (Next 2 Months)**  
- Master Embedded Linux device drivers, peripherals, and Yocto.
- Switch to a high-paying Embedded Linux contract role.

**Long Term (Next 12 Months)**  
- Transition into full-time FPGA development role.
- Build a strong portfolio with SoC and hardware/software projects.
